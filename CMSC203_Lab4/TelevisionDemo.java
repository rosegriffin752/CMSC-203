//		6. Use calls to the mutator methods to change the channel to the user’s preference and decrease the volume by two.
//		7. Use calls to the accessor methods to print the changed state of the portable.
//		8. Compile and debug this class.
//		9. Run TelevisionDemo again.
//		10. The output for task #5 will appear after the output from above, since we added onto the bottom of the program. The output for task #5 is shown below.
